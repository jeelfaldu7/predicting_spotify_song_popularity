# ðŸŽµ Spotify Song Popularity Prediction using PyTorch

A machine learning project to **predict the popularity score (0â€“100)** of a song based on its audio features using **PyTorch**.  
This project is built for hands-on practice with **deep learning on tabular data**, including data cleaning, exploratory analysis, model training, and performance evaluation.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

The aim of this project is to:

- Load and preprocess the **Ultimate Spotify Tracks DB** dataset.
- Explore patterns between audio features and song popularity.
- Build a **PyTorch regression model** to predict popularity.
- Experiment with neural network architectures and hyperparameters.
- Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance using RMSE and MAE.
- Provide explanations for predictions via feature importance and sensitivity analysis.

This work demonstrates skills in **data preprocessing**, **EDA**, **model building**, and **machine learning evaluation**.
